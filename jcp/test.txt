External Library to be installed: 
Install java-openjfx through your package manager
(Note that java-openjfx is compatible with OpenJDK8, not previous versions.)
 


General Usage:

1. In CPSC-433 directory, run the utility script compile.sh to compile all java files 
   or alternatively from CPSC-433, run the command 
   javac *.java ./OrTree/*.java ./ParseData/*.java ./Parser/*.java ./SetBased/*.java ./Slot_Occupant/*.java 
2. Run the system with: java Driver configFile.txt [input file name]
3. The file configFile.txt contains the following system parameters:

	Soft Constraint Parameters:
	
	1. minFilledWeight  - The weight value for the pen_courseMin and pen_labMin parameters.
	2. prefWeight 	    - The weight value for the preference penalties contained in the input file.
	3. notPairedWeight 	- The weight value for the pen_notPaired parameter.
	4. secDiffWeight    - The weight value for the pen_section parameter.
	5. pen_courseMin	- Penalty to incur if a course time slot is not assigned the minimum number of courses indicated in the input file.
	6. pen_labMin		- Penalty to incur if a lab time slot is not assigned the minimum number of labs indicated in the input file.
	7. pen_notPaired	- Penalty to incur if a pair of courses/labs indicated in the input file are not assigned the same time slot.
	8. pen_section		- Penalty to incur if a pair of sections for a course are assigned the same (or overlapping) time slot(s).
	
	

General Comments: 
If there is an error in the input file, the program ends with an error message. 
The set-based search will run for a fixed number of generations or until no further solution is possible,
it outputs the best solution or a message stating that no possible solution.
